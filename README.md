# Data_Cleaning

## Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to enhance and share skills and techhniques in data cleaning. Datasets will be acquired via open sources (i.e. kaggle, API's, google datasets,etc.).

Each data cleaning projects will include a simple linear/logistic regression or random forest regressor/classifier to show usability of data.


### Pain Pills

Data is 80 GB in size so there is a challenge in storing it in memory. I portion-read the file but the computer was taking too long and using much memory so this dataset will probably explored with Spark in the future.

### NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision

This dataset is incomplete and about 340MB showing no problem with memory use. Will clean the dataset and create visualizations and some predictive analysis and/or classification.
